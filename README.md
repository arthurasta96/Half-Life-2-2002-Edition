# Half-Life 2 2002 Edition

Have you ever heard about the cut content of Half-Life 2? Do you know how much of it was actually cut? What if I told you that the original story was waaayyy longer, richer, and darker? So interesting. But may I guess â€” you've already know it, right?

Back in 2003, during the development of HL2, a man stole the source code, which was later discovered to be playable. The dedicated community of fans came to learn that up until September 2002, Valve had a completely different storyline known as the "Old Story". Due to constant changes in the old story, some chapters were either added or completely removed. The maps underwent numerous revisions, with many of them still unfinished or lacking proper logical order.

Therefore, I have decided to take the liberty of assembling the best leaked maps available (part of them from the canceled E3 2002) and fixing them before delivering them to you. Consider it like a polished story kind of mappack.

Here's you can find the latest version available.
